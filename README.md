Similar to 3-way handshake process also know as half connection attack. The attacker attacks the TCP connection by send number of SYN requests to the server without recieving the acknowledgements. This will allow the attacker to access the files and folders without letting the legitimate user connect the server. THe attack is mitigated using SYN_Cookies done directly during the attack.
